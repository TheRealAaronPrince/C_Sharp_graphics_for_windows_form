# C_Sharp_graphics_for_windows_form
This is my attempt at making a graphics "driver" for use in c# projects

This is free for anyone to use, and I will be using it in many of my future projects.
while credit is not necessary, it would be appreciated.

If you are unsure of how certain functions work or would like some extra help in using this graphical generator, please feel free to send a message.

all of the other files in this project will require "graphics processor.cs".
if a .cs file requires other files on top of "graphics processor.cs" then it's name will appear here with a list of it's dependancies
