# C_Sharp_graphics_for_windows_form
This is my attempt at making a graphics "driver" for use in c# projects

This is free for anyone to use, and I will be using it in many of my future projects.
while credit is not necessary, it would be appreciated.

other, related, graphics projects (stored in subfolders to keep them organised) will require the "graphics proccessor.cs" file
